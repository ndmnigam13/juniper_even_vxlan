Configuration File: https://github.com/ndmnigam13/juniper_even_vxlan/tree/Configuration-File

Lab Preparation:

•	Add vQFX RE and PFE in eve-ng or GNS3
•	Connect RE and PFE with em1 interface.
•	Connect all devices as per Lab diagram.
•	Console to vQFX RE
•	Steps to follow on all vQFX RE.
  1.Go to edit and type delete and say ‘Yes’
  2.set system root-authentication encrypted-password – set root password.
  3.set interfaces em1 unit 0 family inet address 169.254.0.2/24 – This is required for talking RE to PEF as we did delete all default configuration hence, we need to apply this again.
  4.set system host-name <hostname>
  5.commit
  6.request system power-off all-members.
  7.Once all RE shutdown then start manually – This is required as we delete initial configuration and there is some bug in QFX virtual devices in eve-ng/GNS3 if we don’t power-off and power-on then traffic will not flow even though FPC and PIC are online.
  8.Start copy given configuration as per given config file for each device and commit.
  9.Add additional host devices per your choice, I used just given default Virtual PC with basic IP address configuration and tested with pic between them.

Open Task:
  • Configure CUST_B
